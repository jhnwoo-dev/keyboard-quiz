# keyboard-quiz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind this project was to combine aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single unique quiz. This was built to practice the utility of JavaScript in a quiz format that would practice the creation of functions, if-stements, function calling, and many other aspects. This projects solved the problem of troubleshooting my personal pseudocoding to be able to create somewhat of a functional quiz. I learned that when you are calling in items in JavaScript from the document, you have to pay attention to what type of content is being called, which will have different properties that will allow that specific element to be changed.

This project is still in-progress, as I have not been able to complete the post-quiz content of receiving user initial submission and displaying of a local storage. This will be something that will continue to be worked on. I am also having an issue where the first questions will not display "Correct" when the user selects the correct answer, I have yet to figure out why that may be the case and that will also continute to be worked on.

## Installation

Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code.
Once you are at the correct repo, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal. Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.
When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally.

For Windows: git clone "key that was copied to your clipboard" --> enter

## Usage

Click on the "Click to Start!" to prompt the quiz to begin.

The timer will begin, the question will be prompted, and the choices will be available for the user to click on.

Once the user clicks on an answer choice, there will be a text at the bottom of the application that will notify the user if the selection was correct or incorrect.

TO BE WORKED ON:
Once the user has completed all questions, the timer will stop and new elements will display to prompt the user to input their intials as well as display the user's score.
The user will be able to submit their intials, which will save the input and the score into a local storage, which will be recalled and displayed on a new "scoreboard" element.
